        <p>Chit funds are a popular option for those who want to save money and also borrow money as and when the requirement arises. Chit funds have a unique business model so that they afford the opportunity to save and borrow money at the same time. In India, chit funds are governed by the Chit Funds Act, 1982. The Act makes registration of chit funds mandatory. The Act also prescribes the various rules and procedures that have to be followed by a chit fund business. On 20th November 2019, the Chit Funds Amendment Bill, 2019 was passed by the Lok Sabha. The bill makes several changes in the Act, aimed at addressing the concerns faced by the various stakeholders involved with chit funds.
